Well, simple thing as you have seen in this title. My iPad fell off my bed and turned into this bad situation:

As it was a 3rd generation iPad(The new iPad, a very out of time device now), repairing it with a new screen seemed to be easy(Not like the after generations which use thinner screens and led the repair work to the hell difficulty).  
  
Anyway I was able to get some new parts of my iPad(Only 270 RMB) from a mystical website and it made possibilities for me to continue the job.

The screen:

First melt the glue inside the edges in order to get the old screen off.

Remove the four small screws in the corners, then take the screen off after which you can see the board, must be careful, don't make the inner wire broken.

Left for the inner screen wire, right for the external screen(which was broken). Replace the screen by pluging in new one after opening the wire slot.

Now Let's pray for the poor victim...

Put the screws back then use anything sticky to stick two parts together. I had to admit that the glue I used is not very suitable on this occation.

Finished! And it still works in good situation now.
