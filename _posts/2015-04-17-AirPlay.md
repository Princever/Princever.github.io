Here's a blog about realizing the AirPlay Funtion on a Raspberry Pi.  
  
The equipments I used are:





	Raspberry * 1;
	Macbook Pro * 1;
	Ipad * 1;
	Earphone * 1;

---------------------

So, with above equipments got ready, Let's update the software source first.

	apt-get update

The second step is to change the audio output settings. As AirPlay have default settings(HDMI), since the we don't have a external display here, so change the settings to only output audio here.

	amixer cset numid=3 1

Now it's the turn of dealing with software on Linux of my Raspberry Pi. Firstly install the shairport dependencies pack here.

	apt-get install git libao-dev libssl-dev libcrypt-openssl-rsa-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl libwww-perl avahi-utils libmodule-build-perl

The next step is to install the Perl NET-SDP pack cause the iOS system requires this pack to support the airplay function. Using the following command line instruction:

	git clone https://github.com/njh/perl-net-sdp.git perl-net-sdp

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/images/AirPlay/4.png)

Then

	cd perl-net-sdp
	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/images/AirPlay/5.png)

OK, now we can install the shairport, which is an airplay emulator can help us finish the job.
Using

	cd ../

to back to the upper directoryï¼Œrunning following instructions in order:

	git clone https://github.com/hendrikw82/shairport.git

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/images/AirPlay/6.png)

	cd shairport
	make

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/images/AirPlay/7.png)

Well done! We can start the airplay service right now! Here AirPrince is the name of my AirPlay device(Raspberry in this situation).

	./shairport.pl -a AirPrince

Turn on WIFI on iPad to search AirPlay devices for airplaying, and plug the earphone in the Raspberry Pi for enjoying the airplayed music now!
